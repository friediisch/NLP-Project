The Impact of New Media on Intercultural Communication in Global Context 
'''


abstract = '''
The rapid development of new media has been the main force accelerating the trend of globalization in   human   society   in   recent   decades.   New   media   has   brought   human   interaction   and   society   to   a   highly   interconnected and complex level, but at the same time challenges the very existence of intercultural communication in  its  traditional  sense.  It  is  under  this  circumstance  that  we  see  more  and  more  scholars  becoming  involved  in  the  investigation of the relationship between new media and intercultural communication. Emerging topical areas in this line of research mainly include three categories: (1) the impact of national/ethnic culture on the development of new media,  (2)  the  impact  of  new  media  on  cultural/social  identity,  and  (3)  the  impact  of  new  media  (especially  social  media) on different aspects of intercultural communication (e.g., intercultural relationships, intercultural adaptation, and  intercultural  conflict).  This  paper  discusses  this  trend  of  research  on  the  relationship  between  new  media  and  intercultural communication.

The  history  of  human  communication  began  with  the  oral  or  spoken  tradition.  Through  the  course  of  history, the dissemination of messages progressed from simply   the   oral   tradition,   to   script,   print,   wired   electronics,   wireless   electronics   and   finally   digital   communication.    The    greatest    change    in    message    dissemination   in   recent   history   occurred   with   the   introduction  of  computers  and  the  Internet  in  the  early  1990s. Since then, this drastic change of communication medium  has  significantly  affected  humans’  perception  of  the  media,  the  usage  of  time  and  space,  and  the  reachability and control of the media.  In  the  present  age  of  digital  communication,  time  has  been  compressed  by  reducing  the  distance  between  different points in space, and the sense of space has led people  to  feel  that  local,  national,  and  global  space  becomes   obsolete   (Harvey,   1990).   In   addition,   the   reachability  of  digital  media  can  now  extend  to  all  people, instead of a limited audience. This is significant because without the confinement of time and space, the control  of  message  production  and  dissemination  is  no  longer  a  privilege  possessed  only  by  church,  state,  and  government,    but    instead,    equally    shared    by    all    individuals.  All  these  innovations  in  digital  media,  or  so-called  new  media,  have  changed  and  continue  to  change  the  way  we  think,  act,  and  live.  For  example,  digitalization,  as  a  hybridization  of  print  and  electronic  media  in  a  binary  code,  converts  analog  to  digital  that  requires  a  completely different mode of production and distribution.  As  Chen  (2007)  indicated,  the  impact  of  digital  or  new  media  on  human  society  is  demonstrated  in  the  aspects  of  cognition,  social  effect,  and  a  new  form  of  aesthetics.  Cognitively,  new  media  demands  a  non-linear   nature   and   the   creation   of   expectations   for   content,  which  directly  influences  the  way  people  use  media.  Socially,  the  most  manifested  impact  of  new  media  is  the  effect  of  demassification,  which  denotes  that  the  traditional  design  for  a  large,  homogeneous  audience   is   disappearing   and   being   replaced   by   a   specific and individual appeal, allowing the audience to access  and  create  the  message  they  wish  to  produce  (Olason  &  Pollard,  2004).  Visually,  new  media  brings  forth  a  new  digital  aesthetic  view,  which  refers  to,  for  example,  “interactivity,  manipulation,  the  prepurposing  and  repurposing  of  content  across  media,  deliberate  creation of virtual experience, and sampling as a means of generating new content” (Chen, 2007, p. 95).   New  media  is  also  the  main  force  accelerating  the  trend    of    globalization    in    human    society.    The    globalization  trend  has  led  to  the  transformation  of  almost   all   aspects   of   human   society.   For   instance,   socially  and  culturally,  globalization  has  changed  the  perception   of   what   a   community   is,   redefined   the   meaning   of   cultural   identity   and   civic   society,   and   demanded  a  new  way  of  intercultural  interaction  (Chen  &  Zhang,  2010).  Economically,  global  competition  has  enormously  intensified.  In  order  to  succeed  in  global  business,  a  company  is  required  to  not  only  understand  the  local  markets  in  order  to  meet  their  global  clients’  needs,   but   they   must   also   seek   out   open   markets   globally,  and  foster  effective  management  in  global  business transactions (Gupta & Govindarajan, 2007).  In sum,  due  to  the  thrust  of  new  media,  the  global  trend  creates  new  social  networks  and  activities,  redefines  political,  cultural,  economic,  geographical  and  other  boundaries  of  human  society,  expands  and  stretches  social   relations,   intensifies   and   accelerates   social   exchanges,  and  involves  both  the  micro-structures  of  personhood and macro-structures of community (Steger, 2009). 
China Media Research, 8(2), 2012, Chen, Impact of New Media on Intercultural Communication http://www.chinamediaresearch.net  2   editor@chinamediaresearch.net From   the   scholarly   perspective,   unfortunately,   traditional  studies  seldom  connected  well  or  integrated  the   two   concepts   of   “media”   and   “globalization”   (Rantanen, 2006). Three established academic fields on the   study   of   the   concepts   include   communication   studies,  media  and  cultural  studies,  and  globalization  studies. Communication studies began after World War II and become an academic field during the 1950s in the United States. Beginning with early studies focusing on international          communication          and          speech          communication and continuing on to recently developed intercultural  communication,  communication  studies  as  an   academic   field   tends   to   ignore   the   relationship   between people and media, or how people use media in different  cultural  contexts,  and  how  that  closely  relates  to the globalization of human society. The  field  of  media  and  cultural  studies  emerged  in  the   1970s   in   Britain   on   the   basis   of   resisting   the   dominance  of  communication  studies  in  the  United  States,  which  was  more  oriented  towards  the  empirical  or  discovery  paradigm.  Yet,  most  British  media  studies  focus  on  the  role  media  institutions  play  in  the  process  of globalization. Many scholars in this area tend to take globalization  for  granted,  by  not  making  an  effort  to  theorize  the  concept  (Sparks,  1998;  Thussu,  2000).  As  for   cultural   studies,   originated   from   the   Frankfurt   School  in  Germany,  the  field  suffers  from  the  lack  of  concern  about  the  impact  media  has  on  people.  The  problems that exist in media studies and cultural studies are   like   those   that   appear   between   the   studies   of   international       communication       and       intercultural       communication. As Servaes (2008) pointed out, cultural studies  in  Europe  and  in  the  United  States  mainly  pays  attention to cultural issues instead of media issues. The study of globalization began in the early 1990s, a  time  when  the  trend  of  globalization  significantly  increased its impact on human society in terms of scope and    scale.    Nevertheless,    although    scholars    from    different   disciplines   are   involved   in   the   study   of   globalization   (e.g.,   Giddens,   1990;   Pieterse,   2009;   Robertson,  1992;  Waters,  1995),  and  most  agreed  that  without  media  and  communication  globalization  will  not    emerge    as    such    a    great    impetus    of    the    transformation  of  human  society,  the  role  of  media  and  communication  in  the  theorization  of  the  concept  of  globalization    remains    vague    and    less    specified.    Surprisingly,    according    to    Rantanen    (2006),    the    contribution  of  scholars  from  the  field  of  media  and  communication to globalization theories is far less than scholars  from  other  disciplines  such  as  anthropology  and sociology.  The  separation  problem  of  communication  studies,  cultural/media   studies,   and   globalization   studies   in   scholarly   research   has   been   gradually   alleviated   in   recent  years,  but  more  studies  in  this  direction  are  still  needed.  It  is  then  the  purpose  of  this  paper  to  integrate  these    concepts    through    the    examination    of    the    relationship   between   new   media   and   intercultural   communication.  In  order  to  explore  how  new  media  influences  the  process  of  intercultural  communication,  the  discussion  in  this  paper  contains  two  parts.  In  the  first  part,  I  explicate  the  nature  of  new  media  and  its  interdependent  relationship  with  globalization.  In  the  second  part,  I  explain  the  impact  of  new  media  on  intercultural        communication        from        different        perspectives.  New Media and Globalization As mentioned above, the rapid development of new media has been the main force accelerating the trend of globalization  in  human  society  during  the  last  few  decades.  With  its  distinctive  and  unique  nature,  new  media  has  brought  human  interaction  and  society  to  a  highly  interconnected  and  complex  level.  Through  this  convergence the mutual enhancement of new media and globalization has led to the transformation of almost all the   aspects   of   human   society.   New   media   being   considered  “new”  is  not  only  because  of  its  successful  integration  in  the  form  of  the  traditional  interpersonal  and  mass  media,  but  also  because  of  its  new  functions  that  enable  individuals  to  equally  control  messages  in  interpersonal   media,   which   allows   them   to   control   messages  in  mass  media  (Crosbie,  2002).  New  media  functionally  allows  people  to  interact  with  multiple  persons  simultaneously  with  the  ability  to  individualize  messages in the process of interaction. New  media  enjoys  five  distinctive  characteristics:  digitality,   convergency,   interactivity,   hypertextuality,   and virtuality (Chen & Zhang, 2010; Flew, 2005; Lister, Dovery,   Giddings,   Grant,   &   Kelly,   2009).   First,   digitalization  is  the  most  prominent  feature  of  new  media.   New   media   or   digital   media   dematerializes   media  text  by  converting  data  from  analog  into  digital  form, which allows all kind of mathematical operations. New media also makes it possible for a large amount of information to be retrieved, manipulated, and stored in a very limited space.  Second,   new   media   converges   the   forms   and   functions      of      information,      media,      electronic      communication,     and     electronic     computing.     The     convergence   power   of   new   media   can   be   easily   demonstrated by the emergence of the Internet in terms of   its   powerful   function   embedded   in   computer   information          technologies          and          broadband          communication networks. This also leads to the industry convergence  displayed  by  the  constant  merger  of  big  media    companies    and    the    product    and    service    convergence  evidenced  by  the  successful  connection  and   combination   of   media’s   material,   product,   and   service in the media industry.      Third,  the  interactive  function  of  new  media,  i.e.,  between  users  and  the  system  regarding  the  use  of  
China Media Research, 8(2), 2012, Chen, Impact of New Media on Intercultural Communication http://www.chinamediaresearch.net  3   editor@chinamediaresearch.net information resources, provides users a great freedom in producing  and  reproducing  the  content  and  form  of  the  information   during   the   interaction.   In   addition,   the   interactivity of new media makes the interaction among different  networks  and  the  retrieving  of  information  through  different  operational  systems,  both  available  and    convenient.    The    freedom    in    controlling    the    information  endows  new  media  a  great  power  in  the  process of human communication.  Fourth,  the  hypertextuality  of  new  media  brings  forth  a  global  network  center  in  which  information  can  freely  move  around  and  spontaneously  interconnect.  This global network phenomenon has begun to rebuild a new  life  experience  for  human  beings,  which  in  turn  will  lead  the  transformation  of  economic  activities,  cultural  patterns,  interactional  styles,  and  other  aspects  of human society (Castells, 2000).  Finally,   the   cyberspace   formed   by   new   media   allows people to generate virtual experience and reality. The   invisible   cyberspace   not   only   induces   a   gap   between  reality  and  virtuality,  but  also  effectuates  the  free     alternation     of     one’s     gender,     personality,     appearance,  and  occupation.  The  formation  of  virtual  community  that  crosses  all  the  boundaries  of  human  society  definitely  will  challenge  the  way  we  perceive  reality  and  have  traditionally  defined  identity.  (Jones,  1995). With  these  distinct  features  new  media  pushes  the  trend  of  globalization  to  its  highest  level  in  human  history.   As   defined   by   Steger   (2009),   globalization   “refers  to  the  expansion  and  intensification  of  social  relations   and   consciousness   across   world-time   and   world-space” (p. 15). In other words, globalization is “a social process in which the constraints of geography on social  and  cultural  arrangements  recede  and  people  become   increasingly   aware   that   they   are   receding”   (Waters,   1995,   p,   3).      It   involves   the   expansion,   stretching,  intensification,  and  acceleration  of  social  activities   in   both   objective/material   and   subjective/   human   consciousness   levels,   or   different   levels   of   human  society,  including  the  entire  world,  a  specific  nation,   a   specific   industry   or   organization,   and   an   individual (Govindarajan & Gupta, 1997).  The powerful impact of globalization, enhanced by the  advent  of  new  media,  is  revealed  in  its  dynamic,  pervasive,  interconnected,  hybridized,  and  individually  powerful attributes (Chen, 2005; Chen & Zhang, 2010). First,  globalization  is  a  dialectically  dynamic  process,  which is caused by the pushing and pulling between the two  forces  of  cultural  identity  and  cultural  diversity,  or  between   localization   and   universalization.   Second,   globalization  is  universally  pervasive.  It  moves  like  air  penetrating  into  every  aspect  of  human  society  and  influences  the  way  we  live,  think,  and  behave.  Third,  globalization  is  holistically  interconnected.  It  builds  a  huge matrix in which all components are interconnected with   networks.   Fourth,   globalization   represents   a   culturally   hybridized   state,   which   allows   cultural   transmission via new media to take place at a very rapid rate  by  permeating  and  dissolving  human  boundaries.  Finally,  globalization  increases  individual  power  in  the  new   media   society,   which   pluralizes   the   world   by   recognizing  the  ability  and  importance  of  individual  components.  Together,   the   dialectically   dynamic,   universally   pervasive,      holistically      interconnected,      culturally      hybridized,  and  individually  powerful  characteristics  of  globalization  enhanced  and  deepened  by  the  stimulus  and  push  of  the  emergence  of  new  media  has  led  to  revolutionary    changes    in    people’s    thinking    and    behaviors,   redefined   the   sense   of   community,   and      restructured  human society.  The  impact  of  the  integration  of  new  media  and  globalization   can   be   summarized   into   five   precise   effects,  namely,  a  shrinking  world,  the  compression  of  time  and  space,  close  interaction  in  different  aspects  of  society,      global      connectivity,      and      accelerated      local/global  competition/cooperation  (Chen  &  Starosta,  2000). In other words, boundaries of human societies in terms   of   space,   time,   scope,   structure,   geography,   function,   profession,   value,   and   beliefs   are   swiftly   changing   and   transforming   into   a   new   pattern   of   similarities and interconnectedness.   Nevertheless,       although       the       interdependent       relationship  of  new  media  and  globalization  is  evident,  the   specific   connection   between   the   five   distinctive   characteristics of new media (i.e., digitality, convergency, interactivity,  hypertextuality,  and  virtuality),  and  the  five  manifest   features   of   globalization   (i.e.,   dialectically   dynamic,         universally         pervasive,         holistically         interconnected,  culturally  hybridized,  and  individually  powerful),  remain  a  valuable  research  topic  for  scholars  to   further   pursue.   This   paper   only   focuses   on   the   discussion  of  the  relationship  between  new  media  and  intercultural communication.  The  next  section  first  delineates  the  impact  of  new  media  on  human  communication,  especially  from  the  intercultural  communication  perspective,  and  discusses  the  present  research  on  the  impact  of  new  media  on  intercultural communication. The Impact of New Media on Intercultural Communication With its distinctive features new media has brought human  society  to  a  highly  interconnected  and  complex  level,  but  at  the  same  time,  it  challenges  the  very  existence  of  human  communication  in  the  traditional  sense.  New  media  not  only  influences  the  form  and  content of information/messages, but it also affects how people  understand  each  other  in  the  process  of  human  communication,   especially   for   those   from   different   cultural or ethnic groups. 
China Media Research, 8(2), 2012, Chen, Impact of New Media on Intercultural Communication http://www.chinamediaresearch.net  4   editor@chinamediaresearch.net On  the  one  hand,  intrinsically,  the  new  culture  hatched   from   new   media   creates   a   continuity   gap   between  traditions  and  innovations  within  a  culture.  Before   the   emergence   of   new   media,   according   to   Bagdasaryan   (2011),   traditions   and   innovations   in   human     society     co-existed     in     a     dynamically     synchronized way, but the speed and impact of the new media  resulted  in  the  inability  of  traditional  values  to  keep pace with the new cultural values produced by new media.   This   cultural   gap   has   caused   difficulty   in   understanding  or  communication  between  generations  and among people in the same culture. New       media       also       extrinsically       breeds       communication   gaps   between   different   cultural   and   ethnic groups. The fragmented nature of new media has switched  traditional  cultural  grammar,  cultural  themes,  or cultural maps to a new pattern, resulting in the loss of traditional    cultural    logic.    The    rearrangement    or    restructuring    of    cultural    patterns,    or    worldview,    demands   that   members   of   a   culture   realign   their   communication behaviors within their own community, and to learn a new way of interaction with people from differing  cultures.  New  media  fosters  a  new  culture  in  human  society,  in  which  the  degree  of  ambiguity  and  uncertainty  has  been  reshuffled  and  has  reached  its  highest  point,  especially  in  the  process  of  intercultural  communication.  How  to  readjust  to  this  new  situation  and smoothly achieve the goal of mutual understanding for people from different cultural groups in this chaotic stage  of  cultural  change  becomes  a  great  challenge  for  the   practical   need   of   interaction   in   daily   life   and   research  in  the  scholarly  community.  It  is  under  this  circumstance  that  we  see  more  and  more  scholars  are  becoming    involved    in    the    investigation    of    the    relationship   between   new   media   and   intercultural   communication (Allwood & Schroeder, 2000; Pfister & Soliz, 011; Shuter, 2011).  After examining the extant literature, we found that emerging  topical  areas  in  this  line  of  research  mainly  include     three     categories:     (1)     the     impact     of     national/ethnic   culture   on   the   development   of   new   media,  (2)  the  impact  of  new  media  on  cultural/social  identity,  and  (3)  the  impact  of  new  media  (especially  social   media)   on   different   aspects   of   intercultural   interaction  (e.g.,  intercultural  relationship,  intercultural  dialogue, and intercultural conflict).  National/Ethnic Culture and New Media   As  Weick  (1983)  pointed  out,  in  the  international  electronic  exchange  culture  plays  a  significant  role  in  affecting the process and outcome of the interaction. In other  words,  culture  as  a  communication  context  may  dictate  the  use  of  media.  Chen  (2000)  found  that  three  cultural  factors,  namely  thinking  patterns,  expression  styles,  and  cultural  context,  are  the  three  prominent  cultural  factors  that  influence  how  people  behave  in  electronic    media,    and    the    three    factors    are    the    manifestation   of   cultural   values   (Chen   &   Starosta,   2005).  Based  on  the  distinction  of  low-context  culture  and  high-context  culture  categorized  by  Hall  (1976),  Chung     and     Chen     (2007)     proposed     possible     communication  differences  for  members  in  the  two  groups  in  the  process  of  electronic  interaction  (p.  285)  (see Table 1):   Table 1 Differences between Low- and High-Context Cultures in E-communication LCC                                          HCC              Meaning              display                                          explicit                                          implicit              Value              orientation                                          individual                            group              Personal              relationship                            transitory                            permanent              Action              base                                          procedure                            personal              Logic                                                        linear                                          spiral              Message              learning              time                            short                                          long              Verbal              interaction                            direct                                          indirect              Nonverbal              style                                          individualistic                            contextual              Idea              presentation                                          logic                                          feelings              Message              style                                          detailed                                          simple              Credibility              source                                          authority                            communication              source                                                        It is assumed that cultural values will influence the social   networking   process   in   new   media   (Vasslou,   Joinson, & Coourvoisier, 2010; Veltri & Elgarah, 2009; Vinuales,  2011).  Hall’s  (1976)  low-context  and  high-context  cultures  and  Hofstede’s  (2001)  individualism  and  collectivism  dimensions  of  cultural  values  are  two  of  the  most  common  models  used  in  the  study  of  the  relationship  between  culture  and  media.  For  example,  Kim,  Sohn,  and  Choi  (2010)  found  that  cultural  value  orientations  affect  a  user’s  attitude  when  using  new  
China Media Research, 8(2), 2012, Chen, Impact of New Media on Intercultural Communication http://www.chinamediaresearch.net  5   editor@chinamediaresearch.net media.   Their   study   demonstrates   that   although   the   motives  for  using  social  media  are  similar  for  students,  those  in  high-context,  collectivistic  cultures,  such  as  Korean   college   students,   show   more   emphasis   on   attaining     social     support     from     existing     social     relationships, while those in low-context, individualistic cultures,  such  as  American  college  students,  tend  to  show more interest in seeking entertainment rather than social  relationships.    Moreover,  Rosen,  Stefanone,  and  Lackaff  (2010)  as  well  found  that,  compared  to  high-context,  collectivistic  cultures  in  the  process  of  new  media interaction, people in low-context, individualistic cultures tend to emphasize individual achievements and self-promotion  to  extend  their  social  relations  network,  though the orientation may trade privacy in the network. New Media and Cultural Identity The  convergence  of  new  media  and  globalization  brings  about  at  least  six  new  experiences  for  human  beings, including new textual experiences, new ways of representing the world, new relationships between users and  new  media  technologies,  new  conceptions  of  the  biological  body’s  relationship  to  technological  media,  and new patterns of organization and production (Lister, Dovery,   Giddings,   Grant,   &   Kelly,   2009).   These   experiences   will   inevitably   challenge   the   traditional   formation and definition of social or cultural identity. In other words, the use of new media is shaking the root of cultural  identity  by  weakening  or  strengthening  the  intensity   of   the   relationship   between   people   and   community (Hampton & Wellman, 1999; Singh, 2010).  The   time   and   space   compression   caused   by   the   convergence  of  new  media  and  globalization  creates  a  universal  cyberspace  in  which  new  cultural  identity  is  emerging in different virtual communities.   The  new  cultural  identity  formed  by  new  media  may  not  change  the  traditional  meaning  of  cultural  identity  as  a  unique  product  through  interaction  in  a  specific group context, which gives members a sense of belongings  to  the  group,  but  it  will  directly  challenge  the  traditional  attributes  of  cultural  identity,  namely,  temporality,   territoriality,   constrastivity,   interactivity,   and   multiplicity   (Belay,   1996).   More   specifically,   cultural  identity  fostered  by  new  media  is  no  longer  a  product  of  historical  development  (i.e.,  temporality)  confined   in   an   avowal   process   of   people   in   a   geographical  place  (i.e.,  territoriality).  It  may  still  be  a  distinct collective consciousness based on the members’ sense-making  process  (i.e.,  contrastivity).  The  virtual  community   is   characterized   by   a   higher   degree   of   heterogeneity and a lower level of interconnection (Van Dijk,    1998).    In    addition,    social    interaction    (i.e.,    interactivity)  as  the  foundation  of  developing  cultural  identity  remains  unchanged  in  the  age  of  new  media,  but  the  nature  of  interpersonal  and  group  relationships  via social interaction in the virtual community is unlike those     constructed     from     traditional     face-to-face     interaction.   Finally,   it   is   still   unknown   if   the   new   cultural  identity  formed  by  new  media  will  continue  to  be a multi-faceted concept or practice (i.e., multiplicity), which  can  contrast  with  the  six  facets  of  traditional  cultural  identity  indicated  by  Belay  (1996),  including  sociological  identities,  occupational  identities,  geobasic  identities,  national  identities,  co-cultural  identities,  and  ethnic identities. In  sum,  new  media  continues  to  establish  different  kinds of new communities without the limit of time and space,  which  makes  cultural  identity  more  dynamic,  fluid, and relativized, and imposes austere challenges to the  autonomy  and  stability  of  cultural  identity  (Tan,  2005; Tenenboim-Weinblatt, 2010). The impact of new media on cultural identity has become one of the issues intercultural     communication     scholars     are     most     concerned about (e.g., Chen & Zhang, 2010; Cheong & Gary, 2011; Chiang, 2010; Halualani, 2008; Huffaker & Calvert,   2006;   Kennedy,   2006;   Koc,   2006;   Wang,   Huang,  Huang,  &  Wang,  2009;  Wang,  Walther,  &  Hancock,  2009;  Weber  &  Mitchell,  2008;  William,  Martins, Consalvo, & Ivory, 2009) New Media and Intercultural Interaction   The  impact  of  new  media  on  different  aspects  of  intercultural  interaction  is  apparent  and  has  attracted  more      and      more      studies      from      intercultural      communication   scholars.      This   part   discusses   the   influence  of  new  media  on  three  common  aspects  of  intercultural     interaction     in     the     global     context:     intercultural  relationship,  intercultural  adaptation,  and  intercultural conflict. Intercultural relationships    New   media,   especially   social   media   such   as   Facebook,  blogs,  MySpace,  YouTube,  Twitter,  and  the  iPhone,  have  enabled  people  from  every  corner  of  the  world  to  represent  themselves  in  a  particular  way  and  stay  connected  in  cyberspace.    It  is  obvious  that  the  flexibility  of  information  presented  and  shared  in  the  new  media  will  directly  affect,  either  positively  or  negatively,      the      development      of      intercultural      relationships    in  the  virtual  community  through  the  creation of a network of personal connection (e.g., Boyd &   Ellision,   2007;   Donath   &   Boyd,   2004;   Ellison,   Steinfield,  &  Lanmpe,  2007;  Parks  &  Floyd,  1996;  Walther, 1992).  Moreover,  Elola  and  Oskoz  (2009)  found  that  in  foreign  language  and  study  abroad  contexts,  the  use  of  blogging  not  only  showed  a  positive  effect  on  the  development   of   intercultural   relationships,   but   also   increased   the   degree   of   participants’   intercultural   communication competence.  In addition to intercultural relationships on a personal level, social media also helps to     establish     international     business     relationships     
China Media Research, 8(2), 2012, Chen, Impact of New Media on Intercultural Communication http://www.chinamediaresearch.net  6   editor@chinamediaresearch.net (Jackson,  2011).  Nevertheless,  new  media  may  also  produce      a      negative      impact      on      intercultural      communication.  For  example,  Qian  and  Scott  (2007)  found  that  revealing  too  much  personal  information  in  blogs,   especially   negative   information   about   one’s   friends,  employer,  and  others,  tends  to  jeopardize  or  cause   problems   in   establishing   constructive   human   relationships intraculturally and interculturally.  Finally,  McEwan  and  Sobre-Denton  (2011)  argued  that  computer-mediated  communication  can  promote  and  develop  virtual  cosmopolitanism  and  virtual  third  cultures.    The    authors    indicated   that   through   the   construction   of   third   culture   space,   a   new,   hybrid   culture  is  created,  in  which  interactants  from  differing  cultures    are    able    to    gather    cultural    and    social    information,   build   online   communities,   and   form   intercultural relationships. Intercultural adaptation   Because  new  media  enables  individuals  across  the  globe    to    exchange    messages    for    the    purpose    of    understanding   people   from   different   cultures,   it   has   become popular for sojourners or immigrants to use new media to communicate with their friends, classmates, and relatives or family members in both their native and host country  in  their  learning  process  or  daily  life  (e.g.,  Chen  Bennett,  &  Maton,  2008;  Trebbe,  2007;  Tsai,  2006;  Ye,  2006).  As  shown  in  W.  Chen’s  (2010)  study,  the  longer  immigrants  reside  in  the  host  country,  the  more  they  communicate  with  the  host  nationals  via  new  media,  but  the frequency of surfing their original country’s websites is  decreasing.    W.  Chen  also  found  that  the  use  of  new  media  shows  a  significant  impact  on  the  process  of  immigrants’  intercultural  adaptation.  In  other  words,  the  social   interaction   conducted   through   new   media   by   immigrants  proves  to  be  a  critical  element  that  can  determine  whether  they  can  successfully  adjust  to  the  host country.   In  addition,  Sawyer  and  Chen  (2011)  investigated  how  international  students  use  social  media  and  how  it  affects  their  intercultural  adaptation.  The  authors  found  that    social    media    provides    an    environment    for    international  students  to  connect  with  people  in  both  their home and host countries, which in turn helps them strengthen  personal  relationships  and  fosters  a  sense  of  belonging  to  the  host  culture.    The  use  of  new  media  obviously helps international students cope with cultural barriers  in  the  process  of  intercultural  adaptation.  The  study  also  found  that,  due  to  the  influence  of  culture  shock,  sojourners  tend  to  rely  more  on  social  media  in  the  initial  stage  of  arriving  in  the  host  country,  to  keep  connected  with  those  people  they  know  in  their  home  country  in  order  to  gain  a  sense  of  comfort  in  the  new  environment. As time moves on, the use of social media was  switched  to  interacting  with  the  host  nationals  to  help them better integrate into the new culture.  Furthermore, Croucher (2011) attempted to propose a    theoretical    model    through    the    integration    of    cultivation  theory  and  ethnic  group  vitality  to  illustrate  the  relationship  between  social  networking  and  cultural  adaptation.    Croucher    successfully    generated    two    propositions: (1) “During cultural adaptation, the use of social  networking  sites  affects  immigrants’  interaction  with  the  dominant  culture”  (p.  261),  and  (2)  “During  cultural  adaptation,  the  use  of  social  networking  sites  will  affect  immigrants’  in-group  communication”  (p.  262).  According  to  the  author,  the  propositions  provide  great  potential  for  future  research  to  investigate  the  impact of of social media on the process of immigrants’ adaptation in the host culture, which may include  frequency   of   interaction   with   dominant   culture,   their  use  of  dominant  and  ethnic  media,  perception  of  the  dominant  culture,  familiarity  with  dominant  language   or   cultural   norms,   identification   with   dominant   or   ethnic   culture,   involvement   in   the   dominant   political   system,   and   motivation   to   acculturate. (p. 262) Intercultural conflict   New  media  provides  people  and  governments  with  a  powerful  tool  to  construct  their  own  image,  to  define  and redefine the meanings of messages, to set the media agenda,  or  to  frame  the  news  or  messages.  However,  cultural dissimilarities result in different ways in media representation  on  the  individual  or  governmental  level.  Because the underlying order, perspectives and practical limitations  of  the  media  in  any  society  are  based  on  their  cultural  value  orientations,  the  different  forms  of  media  representation  tend  to  reflect  the  asymmetry  of  intercultural  communication  and  inevitably  lead  to  the  problem  of  intercultural  confrontation  or  conflict  in  interpersonal,  group,  and  national  levels  (Chen  &  Dai,  in press; Hotier, 2011). The media coverage of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games and Google’s withdrawal from P.R. China are two good examples of the illustration of intercultural conflict in the media context.   According  to  Ni  (2008)  and  Zhou  (2007),  Western  media has long portrayed P.R. China as an authoritarian, backward,  irrational,  and  mysterious  nation.  The  P.R.  China  is  commonly  criticized  by  Western  media  for  abusing   human   rights,   political   corruption,   social   instability,  and  environmental  pollution.  In  order  to  construct   a   positive   national   image,   the   Chinese   government carefully and tactically used its state-owned media  to  set  up  three  agendas  for  the  2008  Beijing  Olympic  Games,  namely,  green  Olympics,  humanistic  Olympics, and scientific Olympics. While most Western media  was  less  prejudiced  and  biased  in  reporting  the  success  of  the  Beijing  Olympic  Games  and  agrees  that  the  games  presented  the  image  of  a  rising  great  power  (Ding,  2011;  Gan  &  Peng,  2008;  Shi  2009),  media  
China Media Research, 8(2), 2012, Chen, Impact of New Media on Intercultural Communication http://www.chinamediaresearch.net  7   editor@chinamediaresearch.net agencies such as the New York Times and Washington Post placed much emphasis on the coverage of protests during  the  Beijing  Olympic  Games  by  criticizing  the  Chinese  government’s  failing  to  fulfill  its  promise  to  loosen restrictions on free speech during the time of the Olympics.  As  Murray  (2011)  argued,  Western  media  coverage  of  the  protest  controversy  is  embedded  in  the  Western  beliefs  in  freedom  of  expression,  human  rights,  individual   equality,   and   social   justice,   which   are   in   contrast  to  Chinese  cultural  values  of  harmony,  face  saving,  group  interest,  and  social  order.  The  coverage  based on different cultural values between Chinese media and Western media made confrontation unavoidable.    As  for  the  case  of  Google’s  withdrawal  from  P.R.  China,  after  the  analysis  of  news  framing  between  China Daily and the Wall Street Journal, Kuang (2011) found  that  the  themes  that  dominated  in  China  Dailywere   criticism   of   Google   and   the   US   government,   Google’s  ploy  to  avoid  censoring,  and  Google’s  loss  and  failure,  while  the  recurring  themes  in  the  Wall Street  Journal  reports  were  about  China’s  violation  of  human      rights/government      censorship,      business-government  relations,  and  international  relations.  The  findings  show  that  news  agencies  often  reflect  their  nation’s  agendas,  interests,  and  values  (Bennett,  1990;  Entman,  1991),  which  eventually  sparks  intercultural  conflict or face-off between countries.  Conclusion  This  paper  examines  the  relationship  between  new  media  and  intercultural  communication  in  the  global  context. It is argued that new media not only provides a space  in  which  people  of  different  cultures  can  freely  express  their  opinions  and  establish  relationships,  but  may     also     challenge     the     existence     of     human     communication    in    intracultural    and    intercultural    contexts  because  of  its  specific  characteristics  that  are  significantly  dissimilar  to  traditional  media.    With  its  focus  on  intercultural  interaction,  this  paper  explicates  the  impact  of  cultural  values  on  new  media,  the  impact  of  new  media  on  cultural  identity,  and  the  impact  of  new  media  on  three  aspects  of  intercultural  interaction,  namely,      intercultural      relationships,      intercultural      dialogue,  and  intercultural  conflict.  Two  implications  can be made based on the delineation of this paper.   First,  this  paper  only  deals  with  the  directional  influence  of  cultural  values  on  new  media,  new  media  on  cultural  identity,  and  new  media  on  intercultural  interaction.  It  is  plausible  that  the  relationship  of  new  media and other variables discussed in this paper can be mutual. In other words, for future research scholars can examine, for example, the possible impact of new media on    the    formation    of    new    cultural    values,    the    transformation  of  or  rendering  obsolete  old  cultural  values, and the impact of cultural identity on the use of new   media.   Moreover,   in   addition   to   the   three   categories  examined  in  this  paper,  the  scope  of  the  relationship   between   new   media   and   intercultural   communication  can  be  expanded  to  other  themes,  such  as  the  investigation  of  co-cultural  variations  in  the  use  of  new  media  to  communication  within  and  across  cultures,   the   impact   of   new   media   on   intercultural   dialogue, and the potential use of new media to resolve intercultural conflicts.   Second  and  finally,  because  the  impact  of  new  media  on  human  society  is  still  in  its  initial  stages,  the  possible effect of new media on human communication mentioned   in   the   first   part   of   this   paper   remains   dynamic    and    still    lacks    systematic    studies    from    scholars.    Hence,    the    impact    of    new    media    on    intercultural  communication  discussed  in  this  paper  is  largely  confined  to  the  old  model  of  media  functions.  How to unlock this limitation and shift from the context of  traditional  media  to  new  media  remains  a  great  challenge for scholars to observe in this line of research. In  other  words,  future  research  needs  to  observe  and  study   the   question,   “Is   intercultural   communication   possible?”  raised  by  Shan  (2010),  under  the  context  of  new media in global society.
